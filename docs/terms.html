        <h2>4. Geographic Restrictions</h2>

        <p>The Game does not involve any real money transactions, real goods, or real services. All in-game currency, goods, and transactions are fictional and have no real-world value. The term "trading" in the Game refers exclusively to in-game fictional activity and does not constitute real financial trading, gambling, or any form of financial instrument.</p>

        <h2>6. No Gambling</h2>

        </ul>
        <p><strong>Wallet Risk Disclosure:</strong> Connecting your wallet involves sharing your public wallet address with the Game.

The Game stores your public address locally on your device only and does not transmit it to any server.</p>

        <h2>8. Historical Fiction Disclaimer</h2>

All content is presented in a historical fiction context.</p>

        <p>Roaring Trades is the intellectual property of Midnight Run Games. All game mechanics, content, and design are original works. The Game is not affiliated with or endorsed by any other game or entity.</p>
