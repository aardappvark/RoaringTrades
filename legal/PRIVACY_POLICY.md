# Privacy Policy

**Roaring Trades**
**Version 1.1.0 | Effective Date: February 10, 2026**

## Overview

Roaring Trades ("the Game") is published by Midnight Run Games, based in Australia. The Game is built with privacy as a core principle. We collect minimal data, store everything locally on your device, and do not use any analytics, tracking, or advertising services.

## Legal Basis for Data Processing

Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR, the legal basis for processing your wallet public address is **legitimate interest** (Article 6(1)(f)) — specifically, the legitimate interest in providing leaderboard functionality that you voluntarily opt into by connecting your wallet. This processing is minimal, expected by the user, and proportionate.

Under the Australian Privacy Act 1988 and Australian Privacy Principles (APPs), the wallet public address is collected in accordance with APP 3 (collection of solicited personal information) for the primary purpose of leaderboard identification.

## Data We Collect

### Wallet Public Key (Required)
- Your Solana wallet public address is stored locally on your device
- Used solely to identify you on the local leaderboard
- This is a public key, not a private key — it cannot be used to access your funds
- Stored using Android EncryptedSharedPreferences (AES-256 encryption)

### Game Scores (Local Only)
- High scores and game results are stored locally on your device
- Associated with your wallet public address for leaderboard display
- Stored using Android EncryptedSharedPreferences (AES-256 encryption)

### Game Preferences (Local Only)
- Disclaimer acceptance status and wallet connection status
- No personal information is stored in preferences

## Data We Do NOT Collect

- Personal information (name, email, phone number)
- Location data
- Device identifiers
- Usage analytics
- Crash reports
- Advertising identifiers
- Browsing history
- Contact lists
- Any financial data
- IP addresses
- Cookies or similar tracking technologies

## Data Storage and Security

All data is stored locally on your device using Android EncryptedSharedPreferences with AES-256-GCM encryption. No data is transmitted to any server, cloud service, or third party. Your data never leaves your device.

## Data Retention

Your data is retained locally on your device for as long as the Game is installed. Data is automatically deleted when you uninstall the Game or clear its data through Android settings.

## Cross-Border Data Transfers

The Game does not transfer any data across borders. All data remains on your local device. There are no servers, cloud storage, or remote databases involved.

## Third-Party Services

The Game uses the following third-party libraries:
- **Solana Mobile Wallet Adapter**: Used to connect to your Solana wallet app. This library communicates directly between the Game and your wallet app on your device. No data is sent to Solana Mobile or any third party.

The Game does NOT include any:
- Analytics SDKs
- Advertising SDKs
- Crash reporting SDKs
- Social media SDKs
- Push notification services

## Blockchain Transparency

When you connect your wallet, your public wallet address is used for leaderboard purposes. Note that Solana wallet addresses are inherently public on the blockchain. The Game does not create any blockchain transactions.

## Your Rights

### Right to Delete (Erasure)
You can delete all Game data at any time by:
1. Going to Android Settings > Apps > Roaring Trades > Clear Data
2. Or uninstalling the Game

This satisfies the right to erasure under GDPR Article 17, UK GDPR, and the Australian Privacy Act.

### Right to Access
All data stored by the Game is visible on the Status screen (wallet address and leaderboard scores). You may also contact us to request a summary of data associated with your wallet address.

### Right to Object
You may object to the processing of your wallet address at any time by disconnecting your wallet in the Game's Status screen, which removes your wallet address from local storage.

### Right to Portability
As all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over your data at all times.

### Right to Lodge a Complaint
If you believe your data protection rights have been violated, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority:
- **Australia**: Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) — oaic.gov.au
- **EU/EEA**: Your local Data Protection Authority
- **UK**: Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) — ico.org.uk

## Children's Privacy

The Game is intended for users 21 years and older. We do not knowingly collect data from anyone under 21. The Game's content (historical alcohol trade themes) is not directed at children or minors. If we become aware that we have collected data from anyone under 21, we will take steps to delete that information.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in the version number and effective date above.
